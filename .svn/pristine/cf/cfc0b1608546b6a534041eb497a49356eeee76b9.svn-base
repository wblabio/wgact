== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is there detailed documentation for the plugin? =

Yes. Head over to this link: [Documentation](https://docs.wolfundbaer.ch/wgact/#/)

= How do I check if the plugin is working properly? =

1. Log out of the shop.
2. Turn off any kind of ad or script blocker in your browser.
3. Search for one of your keywords and click on one of your ads.
4. Purchase an item from your shop.
5. Wait up to 48 hours until the conversion shows up in Google Ads.

With the Google Tag Assistant you will also be able to see the tag fired on the thankyou page.

= I get a fatal error and I am running old versions of WordPress and/or WooCommerce. What can I do? =

As this is a free plugin we don't support old versions of WordPress and WooCommerce. You will have to update your installation.

= I am using an offsite payment gateway and the conversions are not being tracked. What can I do? =

We don't support if an offsite payment gateway is in use. The reason is that those cases can be complex and time consuming to solve. We don't want to cover this for a free plugin. We do not recommend offsite payment gateways anyway. A visitor can stop the redirection manually which prevents at least some conversions to be tracked. Also offsite payment gateways are generally bad for the conversion rate.

= I've done everything right in the test, but it still doesn't work. What can I do? =

Here is a non-exhaustive list of causes that might interfere with the plugin code.

* Minification plugins try to minify the JavaScript code of the plugin. Not all minification plugins do this good enough and can cause problems. Turn off the JavaScript minification and try again.
* Caching could also cause problems if caching is set too aggressively. Generally don't ever enable HTML caching on a WooCommerce shop, as it can cause troubles with plugins that generate dynamic output.

= Where can I report a bug or suggest improvements? =

Please post your problem in the WGACT Support forum: http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/woocommerce-google-adwords-conversion-tracking-tag
You can send the link to the front page of your shop too if you think it would be of help.
