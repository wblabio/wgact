Track the order value and create dynamic remarketing lists in Google Ads from WooCommerce

== Description ==

This plugin <strong>tracks the value of WooCommerce orders and collects data for dynamic remarketing lists in Google Ads</strong>.

With this data you can optimize all your Google Ads campaigns to achieve maximum efficiency.

<strong>Highlights</strong>

* Precise measurement by preventing duplicate reporting effectively, excluding admins and shop managers from tracking, and not counting failed payments.
* Collects dynamic remarketing audiences for dynamic retargeting: [Google Ads Dynamic Remarketing](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/3124536)
* Implements the new Google Add Cart Data functionality. More info about the new feature: [add cart data to the conversion](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/9028254)
* Support for various cookie consent management systems

<strong>Documentation</strong>

<strong>Cookie Consent Management</strong>

The plugin uses data from several Cookie Consent Management plugins to manage approvals and disapprovals for injection of marketing pixels.

It works with the following Cookie Consent Management plugins out of the box:

* [Cookie Notice](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cookie-notice/)
* [Cookie Law Info](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cookie-law-info/)
* [GDPR Cookie Compliance](https://wordpress.org/plugins/gdpr-cookie-compliance/)
* [Borlabs Cookie](https://borlabs.io/borlabs-cookie/) (from version 2.1.0)
  [Borlabs Cookie Setup](https://wolfundbaer.ch/en/blog/our-marketing-plugins-now-support-borlabs-cookie/)

It is also possible for developers of Cookie Consent Management plugins to deactivate the pixel injection with a filter:

`add_filter( 'wgact_cookie_prevention', '__return_true' );`

<strong>Requirements</strong>

[List of requirements](https://docs.wolfundbaer.ch/wgact/#/requirements)

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin directory into your plugins directory `/wp-content/plugins/`
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Get the Google Ads conversion ID and the conversion label. You will find both values in the Google Ads conversion tracking code. [Get the conversion ID and the conversion label](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9gY3JSrNHU)
4. In the WordPress admin panel go to WooCommerce and then into the 'Google Ads Conversion Tracking' menu. Please enter the conversion ID and the conversion label into their respective fields.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is there detailed documentation for the plugin? =

Yes. Head over to this link: [Documentation](https://docs.wolfundbaer.ch/wgact/#/)

= How do I check if the plugin is working properly? =

1. Turn off any kind of caching and / or minification plugins.
2. Log out of the shop.
3. Turn off any kind of ad or script blocker in your browser.
4. Search for one of your keywords and click on one of your ads.
5. Purchase an item from your shop.
6. Wait up to 48 hours until the conversion shows up in Google Ads. (usually takes only a few hours)

With the Google Tag Assistant you will also be able to see the tag fired on the thankyou page.

= I get a fatal error and I am running old versions of WordPress and/or WooCommerce. What can I do? =

As this is a free plugin we don't support old versions of WordPress and WooCommerce. You will have to update your installation.

= I am using an offsite payment gateway and the conversions are not being tracked. What can I do? =

We don't support if an offsite payment gateway is in use. The reason is that those cases can be complex and time consuming to solve. We don't want to cover this for a free plugin. We do not recommend offsite payment gateways anyway. A visitor can stop the redirection manually which prevents at least some conversions to be tracked. Also offsite payment gateways are generally bad for the conversion rate.

= I've done everything right in the test, but it still doesn't work. What can I do? =

Here is a non-exhaustive list of causes that might interfere with the plugin code.

* Minification plugins try to minify the JavaScript code of the plugin. Not all minification plugins do this good enough and can cause problems. Turn off the JavaScript minification and try again.
* Caching could also cause problems if caching is set too aggressively. Generally don't ever enable HTML caching on a WooCommerce shop, as it can cause troubles with plugins that generate dynamic output.

= I see issues in the backend of my shop. Admin pages get rendered weird, and popups don't go away when I click to close them. How can I fix this? =

You probably have some script or ad blocker activated. Deactivate it and the issues should go away. Usually you can disable the blocker for just that particular site (your WooCommerce back end).

Our plugin injects tracking pixels on the front end of WooCommerce shops. As a consequence scripts of our plugin have been added to some privacy filter lists. The idea is to prevent the scripts running if a shop visitor has some ad blocker enabled and wants to visit the front end of the shop. This is totally ok for visitors of the front end of the shop. But, it becomes an issue for admins of the shop who have a blocker activated in their browser and visit the backend of the shop.

Unfortunately there is no way for us to generally approve our scripts in all blockers for the WooCommerce back end.

Therefore we recommend admins of the shop to exclude their own shop from the blocker in their browser.

= Where can I report a bug or suggest improvements? =

Please post your problem in the WGACT Support forum: http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/woocommerce-google-adwords-conversion-tracking-tag
You can send the link to the front page of your shop too if you think it would be of help.
